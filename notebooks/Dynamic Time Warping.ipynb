    "# Dynamic Time Warping\n",
    "\n",
    "DTW is an algorithm for comparing two sequences. The sequences may be of different length. The algorithm will return that sequences are similar if they longer one has a subsequence that is very similar to the shorter one, even if some parts are stretched too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will implement a simple version of DTW that performs $n \\times m$ operations of calculating a distance, where $n$ and $m$ are lengths of compared sequences (lets call them $N$ and $M$ with elements $N_i$ and $M_j$, where indexes start at $0$). The algorithm uses a method of dynamic programming. I will keep whole arrays to visualize the results better, but you can keep only last two rows and compute distances row-wise. It keeps memory usage linear with $m$ and the algorithm remains simple. The final distance between sequences is in the bottom right corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm requires choosing a metric $d$ for measuring distance of single elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms looks like this: We create a distance matrix $D$ of size $(N + 1) \\times (M + 1)$ and set first column and first row all to $\\infty$, except the corner which is set to $0$.\n",
    "Then we fill all the remaining $N \\times M$ cells going row-wise according to this rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D+{i+1, j+1} = min(D_{i+1, j}, D_{i, j+1}, D_{i, j}) + d(N_i, M_j)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Taking $D_{i+1, j}$ means that our current result consists of $d(N_i, M_{j-1})$ and $d(N_i, M_j)$, so you compared same element of sequence N with two elements from pattern M. Eg. $[1, 20, 20, 20, 20], [1, 1, 1, 10]$ will probably take this case a few times.\n",
    "* $D_{i, j+1}$ so your result will consist of $d(N_{i-1}, M_j)$ and $d(N_i, M_j)$, so you matched two elements from sequence with same element in pattern M. Eg. $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 20], [1, 10]$ will use this case to minimize the distance.\n",
    "* $D_{i, j}$ so you used both the next element in sequence N and in pattern M. Eg. $[1, 2, 3, 4]$ and $[1, 2, 3, 4]$."
