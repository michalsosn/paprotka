    "We use 3-state mono-phone HMMs to construct this recognizer. The emission probability of every state is modeled by a GMM. Say we have F mono-phones (F = 39 in our English lexicon), and a G-mixture GMM for each mono-phone state. Thus the GMM-HMM has 3FG mixture components in total. Compared to GMM-UBM, these mixtures are better separated in the phoneme space.\n",
    "\n",
    "MFCC:  MFCCs  are  extracted  from  16kHz  utterance  with  40 filter-banks distributed between 0 and 8kHz. Static 19-dimensional coefficients plus energy and their delta and delta-delta form a 60-dimensional vector. CMVN is applied per utterance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, deepspeech ma 26 MFCC features i zdaje się, że usuwa co drugi, ale to w związku z jakąś sztuczką uczenia RNN. Mają tak: features = mfcc(audio, samplerate=fs, numcep=numcep) gdzie mfcc jest z psf jak u nas xD a numcep=26 domyślnie, a fs=16000 domyślnie\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, inny papier: In our HMM-based method, a phoneme recognizer is firsttrained with 3-state, GMM-based, mono-phone HMMs. Thisrecognizer is the same as in speech recognition. LetFbe thetotal number of mono-phones (i.e. 39),S=3Fbe the numberof all states,Gthe number of Gaussian components per state,andC=SGthe number of all individual Gaussians, and let(s, g)denote Gaussian componentgin states.\n",

    "Given a transcription, a graph of HMM is composed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The  Viterbi  and  forward-backward  (FB)  algorithms  are  twomeans to align frames to states and mixtures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speaker adaption is the same with Eq. 4 except mixtures here are phonetic dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the test phase,  the Viterbi-based log-likelihood ratio is expressed as:\n",
    "sum_t log P(x_t | model_user,qt) - log P(x_t | model_ubm,qt)\n",
    "\n",
    "HMM: To generate the alignment for the HMM-based modeling,we use MFCCs to train the HMM. 39 mono-phones plus a silencemodel are used,  each of which contains 3 states.  To model thecomplexity of silence, a GMM with 16 mixtures is used for every silence state, while other states are all modeled by 8 Gaussians,resulting 984 Gaussians in total. This HMM is further extended toa triphone system and remains 2142 senones.  The transcriptionsfor  DNN  training  is  generated  by  the  senone  alignment.   OnlyMFCCs are used for HMM training and alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "GMM-HMM and i-vector/HMM: The GMM of every state is re-estimated using the HMM alignments and different speaker fea-tures.   The total number of mixtures in our model is 984.   Thedimension of i-vector is again set to 600.  Viterbi and FB align-ments are both investigated\n",
