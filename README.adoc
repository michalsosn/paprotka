= Paprotka

This is a module for my own use where I put some things I implemented while studying.

I usually use Jupyter to run examples. paprotka modules are for
library-like functions to be used in jupyter. To run jupyter, use
the script `runJupyter.sh`. It will automatically install `paprotka` in
editable/develop mode, meaning the changes in paprotka will be visible in jupyter
scripts. You might need to also enable autoreload in notebook

%load_ext autoreload
# %autoreload 2

To build the project `./setup.py build`

To run tests `./setup.py test` (uses pytest)

To clean the build './setup.py clean --all'
